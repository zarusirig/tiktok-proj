## FAQ Templates

### Creator Fund FAQs

**Q: How much does TikTok pay per 1,000 views?**
A: TikTok Creator Fund pays between $0.02–$0.04 per 1,000 views on average, though this varies based on engagement rate, viewer location, and content niche. High-engagement videos in premium niches (finance, business) can earn closer to $0.06–$0.08 per 1,000 views.

**Q: How often does TikTok pay Creator Fund earnings?**
A: Creator Fund payments are processed monthly, typically around the 15th of each month for the previous month's earnings. Payments are sent to your linked PayPal or bank account.

**Q: What are the Creator Fund eligibility requirements?**
A: To join the TikTok Creator Fund, you must:
- Have at least 10,000 followers
- Have at least 100,000 video views in the last 30 days
- Be 18 years or older
- Follow TikTok's Community Guidelines and Terms of Service
- Have an account in good standing

**Q: Why are my Creator Fund earnings dropping?**
A: Creator Fund earnings can fluctuate based on:
- Changes in view count (fewer views = lower earnings)
- Shifts in audience location (more international views may pay less)
- Video watch time (shorter watch times reduce RPM)
- TikTok adjusting the total Creator Fund pool
- Seasonal factors (Q1 typically slower than Q4)

### Engagement Rate FAQs

**Q: What is a good engagement rate on TikTok?**
A: A "good" TikTok engagement rate is generally:
- **Excellent:** 10%+ (top tier)
- **Good:** 5–10% (above average)
- **Average:** 2–5% (typical)
- **Below Average:** <2% (needs improvement)

TikTok engagement rates are typically higher than Instagram due to the algorithm's reach.

**Q: How do I calculate engagement rate?**
A: Engagement Rate = [(Likes + Comments + Shares) / Followers] × 100

For example, if you have 10,000 followers and your videos average 500 likes, 50 comments, and 50 shares (600 total engagements), your engagement rate is 6%.

### Brand Deal FAQs

**Q: How much should I charge for a TikTok sponsorship?**
A: Brand deal rates vary by follower count:
- **10K–50K followers:** $100–$500
- **50K–500K followers:** $500–$5,000
- **500K+ followers:** $5,000–$50,000+

Your exact rate depends on engagement rate, niche, and deliverable type.

**Q: How do I negotiate higher rates with brands?**
A: Negotiation tips:
1. Show your engagement rate (if above 5%)
2. Provide niche-specific audience demographics
3. Share past campaign performance data
4. Start 20–30% higher than your target rate
5. Offer bundled packages for multiple videos
