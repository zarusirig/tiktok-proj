## Content Performance Metrics

### Success Criteria by Page Type

**Calculator Pages:**
- Primary: Tool engagement (calculations performed)
- Secondary: Session duration, bounce rate, conversions to related content

**Hub Pages:**
- Primary: Organic traffic, keyword rankings
- Secondary: Internal link clicks, scroll depth, backlinks earned

**How-To Guides:**
- Primary: Organic traffic, engagement rate
- Secondary: Social shares, time on page

**Comparison Pages:**
- Primary: Organic traffic, branded searches
- Secondary: Backlinks from industry sites

### Quarterly Content Review

**Questions to Answer:**
1. Which pages are driving the most traffic?
2. Which pages have the best engagement?
3. Which pages have dropped in rankings? (Investigate why)
4. Which pages have low traffic despite good rankings? (Improve CTR with better titles/meta)
5. Which topics should we expand? (High traffic = create more related content)
6. Which content is outdated? (Prioritize refresh)

---

## Changelog System

Every major content update should include a changelog at the bottom of the page:

**Format:**
```markdown
## Changelog

**November 13, 2025:** Updated Creator Fund RPM rates to reflect Q4 2024 data. Added new section on TikTok Series monetization.

**August 10, 2025:** Refreshed brand deal rate benchmarks based on 500+ new campaign data points.

**May 1, 2025:** Initial publication.
```

**Benefits:**
- Transparency for users (builds trust)
- Freshness signals for Google
- Internal tracking of update history

---

## Content Archive/Deprecation Policy

**When to Deprecate Content:**
- Feature discontinued by TikTok (e.g., if Creator Fund shut down)
- Content cannibalization (two pages competing for same keyword)
- Permanently outdated (no way to update accurately)

**Process:**
1. Identify page for deprecation
2. Choose best alternative page to redirect to
3. Add notice at top of deprecated page: "This content is outdated. See [Updated Guide] for current information."
4. Wait 30 days
5. Implement 301 redirect to alternative page
6. Monitor traffic for 60 days to ensure redirect is working
7. Archive old content in internal documentation (don't delete—may be useful later)
