## Tone by Content Type

### Calculator Pages
**Tone:** Efficient, helpful, clear

**Good:**
> "Enter your follower count and monthly views to estimate your Creator Fund earnings. We'll show you the calculation breakdown so you understand exactly where the numbers come from."

**Avoid:**
> "OMG! Wanna know how much 💰 you'll make? Just plug in your stats and prepare to be AMAZED!"

### Comprehensive Guides
**Tone:** Authoritative, educational, thorough

**Good:**
> "The TikTok Creator Fund pays creators based on video views and engagement. According to TikTok's official documentation, rates range from $0.02–$0.04 per 1,000 views, though actual earnings vary significantly based on niche, engagement rate, and audience location."

**Avoid:**
> "So like, the Creator Fund is this thing where TikTok gives you money for views. It's pretty random TBH."

### How-To Guides
**Tone:** Encouraging, step-by-step, practical

**Good:**
> "Ready to join the Creator Fund? Follow these five steps to apply. We'll walk you through each requirement and show you exactly what TikTok looks for."

**Avoid:**

## Writing Principles

### 1. Clarity First

**Use simple language:**
- Write at 8th-9th grade reading level
- Define jargon on first use
- Short sentences (average 15–20 words)
- Active voice preferred

**Good:**
> "Your engagement rate measures how actively your audience interacts with your content. Higher engagement typically leads to better algorithmic performance and higher earnings."

**Bad:**
> "The engagement rate metric serves as a quantification methodology for determining the proportional interactive participation coefficient of one's audience constituency."

### 2. Be Specific

**Use concrete examples:**
- Real numbers
- Specific scenarios
- Named examples

**Good:**
> "A creator with 50,000 followers and 5% engagement earning $300/month from the Creator Fund could earn $1,500–$3,000 for a single brand deal."

**Bad:**
> "Creators can earn more from brand deals than the Creator Fund."

### 3. Show, Don't Just Tell

**Use tables, charts, examples:**

**Good:**
| Follower Count | Avg Monthly Earnings |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 10K–50K        | $50–$150             |
| 50K–100K       | $150–$450            |
| 100K–500K      | $500–$2,000          |

**Bad:**
> "Earnings increase as you grow."

### 4. Admit What You Don't Know

**Be honest about limitations:**

**Good:**
> "These estimates are based on reported averages from 500+ creators surveyed in Q4 2024. Your actual earnings may vary based on factors we can't fully predict, including TikTok's algorithm changes and audience location."

**Bad:**
> "This calculator is 100% accurate and will tell you exactly what you'll earn."

## Grammar & Style Rules

### Capitalization

**Product names:**
- TikTok (not Tiktok or tiktok)
- Creator Fund (capitalized)
- LIVE (all caps when referring to TikTok LIVE)
- For You Page (capitalized, can abbreviate as FYP after first use)

**Headings:**
- Sentence case: "How to calculate engagement rate"
- Not title case: "How To Calculate Engagement Rate"

### Numbers

**Spell out:**
- One through nine: "five calculators"

**Use numerals:**
- 10 and above: "15 monetization strategies"
- Percentages: "5% engagement rate"
- Currency: "$150"
- Statistics: "3× more engagement"

### Formatting

**Bold:** Key terms on first use, important takeaways
**Italic:** Emphasis (use sparingly)
**Code blocks:** Formulas, technical terms
**Quotes:** Direct citations only

## Word Choice

### Preferred Terms

| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| Creator | Influencer (unless specifically discussing influencer marketing) |
| Earnings, income, revenue | Money, cash, $$$  |
| Engagement rate | Engagement (ambiguous) |
| Video views | Just "views" (could be profile views) |
| TikTok LIVE | TikTok Live, TikTok live, live streams |
| Brand deal, sponsorship | Paid promo, ad |
| Follower count | Followers, subscriber count |
| Content niche | Vertical, category |

### Avoid

❌ **Hype language:** Amazing!, Incredible!, Insane!, OMG!
❌ **Vague claims:** "Many creators," "Some people," "Often"
❌ **Jargon without explanation:** RPM, CPM, CTA (define first)
❌ **Clickbait:** "You won't believe...," "This one trick..."
❌ **Absolute statements:** "Always," "Never," "Guaranteed"

## Tone by Persona

### Aspiring Creator (18-24, 1K-50K followers)
**Approach:** Encouraging, educational, motivational

**Example:**
> "Just starting out? Don't worry—every mega-creator began where you are. With 10,000 followers and consistent content, you can start earning from the Creator Fund. Use our calculator to see what's possible as you grow."

### Scaling Creator (22-35, 50K-500K)
**Approach:** Strategic, data-driven, optimization-focused

**Example:**
> "At your follower tier, optimizing your monetization mix is crucial. Our brand deal calculator shows you're likely undercharging if you're accepting offers below $800 per video. Use your engagement rate (which is above average for your niche) as leverage in negotiations."

### Professional Creator (25-45, 500K+)
**Approach:** Sophisticated, efficient, authoritative

**Example:**
> "For established creators, the Creator Fund represents passive income—typically 10–15% of total revenue for those actively securing brand deals. Our rate calculator uses industry benchmarks from 1,000+ verified campaigns to help you justify premium pricing."

### Brand/Agency (30-50, Researcher)
**Approach:** Objective, data-backed, professional

**Example:**
> "When budgeting TikTok influencer campaigns, expect to pay 5–10× the creator's monthly Creator Fund earnings for a single in-feed video. Our calculator uses verified market data to estimate fair rates by follower tier, engagement rate, and niche."
