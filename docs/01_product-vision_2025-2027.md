## The Problem We Solve

### Current State (Competitor Analysis: calculatecreator.com)

**Pain Points Identified:**
1. **Shallow Calculators:** Basic revenue estimates with no context or education
2. **Poor UX:** Slow load times, cluttered layouts, mobile unfriendly
3. **Weak SEO:** Thin content, no topical authority, low entity relevance
4. **No Guidance:** Results without interpretation or next steps
5. **Outdated Data:** Formulas don't reflect TikTok's evolving monetization models (TikTok Shop, LIVE subscriptions, etc.)
6. **Zero Trust Signals:** No transparency about methodology or data sources

### Our Solution

A **10–20× better platform** across 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Competitor | Us |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| **UX** | Slow, cluttered, desktop-only | Sub-1s load, mobile-first, delightful interactions |
| **Calculator Depth** | 3–5 basic tools | 15+ specialized calculators covering all monetization streams |
| **Topical Coverage** | Thin listicles | Deep pillar content, semantic entity architecture |
| **SEO** | Keyword stuffing | Koray-method topical authority, E-E-A-T optimization |
| **Speed** | 3–5s load time | <1s LCP, 100 Lighthouse scores |
| **Clarity** | Raw numbers | Contextual insights, actionable recommendations |
