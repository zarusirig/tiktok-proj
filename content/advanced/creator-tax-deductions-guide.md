## FAQ

### Do I need to report income under $600?
Yes. All income is taxable, regardless of whether you receive a 1099.

### Can I deduct my phone if I also use it personally?
Yes, but only the business-use percentage (e.g., 60% business = deduct 60% of cost).

### What if I get audited?
Keep receipts and documentation for all deductions. Audit risk is low if deductions are legitimate and well-documented.

### Can I write off my entire apartment as home office?
No. Only the space used exclusively for business (e.g., 1 room used as office/filming space).

### Do I need a separate business bank account?
Not required for sole proprietors, but highly recommended for tracking expenses and audit protection.
