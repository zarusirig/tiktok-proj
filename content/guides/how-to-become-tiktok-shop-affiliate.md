## How TikTok Shop Affiliate Payments Work

### Commission Structure

**When you earn commission:**
- Viewer clicks your product link → Purchases within 7 days → You earn commission
- Commission calculated on product price (minus taxes, shipping)

**Example:**
> Product price: $50
> Commission rate: 15%
> Your earning: $7.50 per sale

**If viewer adds to cart but doesn't purchase immediately:** You still earn commission if they purchase within 7 days (attribution window).

---

### Payment Schedule

**Payment cycle:**
- Commissions accumulate throughout the month
- Paid monthly (typically mid-month for previous month's sales)
- Minimum payout: $10 (most regions)

**Example timeline:**
- January sales → Paid mid-February
- February sales → Paid mid-March

**Processing time:**
- PayPal: 1–3 days after payout date
- Bank transfer: 5–7 days

---

### Tracking Earnings

**In TikTok Affiliate Dashboard:**
- Total clicks on your links
- Conversion rate (clicks → purchases)
- Total sales volume
- Commission earned (pending and paid)
- Top-performing products

**Check regularly:** Monitor which products drive most sales, double down on those.

## Best Practices for Affiliate Content

### 1. Be Authentic and Honest
- Only promote products you'd genuinely recommend
- Disclose affiliate relationship (FTC requirement): "#ad" or "I earn commission"
- Honest reviews (including cons) build trust → Higher conversion rates

### 2. Show Product in Action
- Don't just hold product and talk about it
- Demonstrate use, show results, provide value
- Before/after content performs well

### 3. Focus on Benefits, Not Features
**Bad:** "This blender has 10 speeds and 1000W motor"
**Good:** "This blender makes my morning smoothie in 30 seconds—perfect for busy mornings"

### 4. Use Strong Hooks
- First 3 seconds determine if viewer keeps watching
- Hook examples:
  - "I've tested 10 [products], this is the only one I recommend"
  - "This $20 product changed my [routine]"
  - "Before you buy [expensive alternative], try this"

### 5. Create Urgency (When Authentic)
- "Limited stock" (if true)
- "Sale ends soon" (if true)
- "I use this daily"

### 6. Leverage Social Proof
- Show product reviews/ratings
- "Over 10,000 5-star reviews"
- Share your real results (before/after)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Promoting Too Many Products
**Problem:** Overwhelming audience, seeming inauthentic

**Fix:** Focus on 5–10 core products that align with your niche

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Only Posting Promotional Content
**Problem:** Audience tunes out if every video is a sales pitch

**Fix:** 70% value content, 30% promotional (example: 7 helpful videos, 3 affiliate videos per 10 posts)

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Disclosing Affiliate Relationship
**Problem:** FTC violation, loss of trust

**Fix:** Always use #ad, mention "I earn commission," or use TikTok's Paid Partnership label

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Promoting Products You Haven't Tried
**Problem:** Inauthentic, risk recommending bad products

**Fix:** Only promote products you've personally tested (or thoroughly researched)

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Ignoring Analytics
**Problem:** Keep promoting low-converting products

**Fix:** Check affiliate dashboard weekly, focus on top performers
