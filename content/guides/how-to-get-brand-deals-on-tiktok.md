## How Brand Deals Work on TikTok

### What is a Brand Deal?

A brand deal (also called sponsorship or paid partnership) is when a company pays you to create content featuring their product or service.

**Common deliverables:**
- In-feed TikTok video (most common)
- TikTok LIVE mention or demo
- Series of videos (campaign)
- Spark Ads authorization (brand boosts your video)
- Cross-platform content (TikTok + Instagram)

### How Much Do Brand Deals Pay?

**Typical rates by follower count:**

| Follower Tier | Rate Range (Per Video) | Average |
|---------------|------------------------|---------|
| 5K–10K (Nano) | $50–$200 | $100 |
| 10K–50K (Micro) | $200–$1,000 | $500 |
| 50K–100K | $1,000–$2,500 | $1,500 |
| 100K–500K (Mid-tier) | $2,500–$10,000 | $5,000 |
| 500K–1M (Macro) | $10,000–$25,000 | $15,000 |
| 1M+ (Mega) | $25,000–$100,000+ | $50,000+ |

**Factors that increase rates:**
- High engagement rate (6%+)
- Niche expertise (finance, tech, B2B)
- Proven conversion history
- Exclusive partnership
- Spark Ads rights included

## 7 Strategies to Attract Brand Deals

### Strategy 1: Optimize Your Profile for Partnerships

**First impressions matter.** Brands review your profile before reaching out.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Professional profile picture (face clearly visible)
- [ ] Bio clearly states your niche (e.g., "Fitness creator | Healthy living tips")
- [ ] Business email in bio (use professional email, not personal)
- [ ] Link to media kit or portfolio site
- [ ] Consistent content theme (brands want clear audience alignment)
- [ ] Switch to TikTok Business Account (access to advanced analytics)

**Bad bio:**
> "Just vibing 🌟 DM for collabs"

**Good bio:**
> "Finance Creator | Helping millennials invest smarter 📈 | Partnerships: creators@email.com"

### Strategy 2: Create Content That Showcases Products Naturally

**Demonstrate your ability to integrate products organically.**

**How to do this:**
1. Create "favorites" or "what I use" videos showing real products you love
2. Make product review videos (honest, balanced)
3. Incorporate products naturally in lifestyle content
4. Show before/after or transformation content

**Why it works:** Brands can see how you'd showcase their product before paying you.

**Example niches and content:**
- **Beauty:** "5 products I can't live without"
- **Fitness:** "What's in my gym bag"
- **Tech:** "My productivity setup tour"
- **Food:** "Kitchen essentials every home cook needs"

### Strategy 3: Tag Brands and Use Product Hashtags

**Get on brands' radar organically.**

**How:**
- Tag brands when you genuinely use their products
- Use branded hashtags in relevant content
- Comment on brands' TikTok posts with value (not "please sponsor me")
- Create content for brand campaigns (even unpaid) to get noticed

**Example:**
If you're a coffee creator, tag @Nespresso in your morning routine video using their machine. They monitor tags and may reach out if content performs well.

**Pro tip:** Smaller/emerging brands are more likely to respond than mega-brands.

### Strategy 4: Join TikTok Creator Marketplace

**TikTok's official platform connecting creators with brands.**

**Eligibility:**
- 18+ years old
- 10,000+ followers (varies by region)
- 100,000+ video views in last 30 days
- Business or Creator account
- No Community Guidelines violations

**How to apply:**
1. Meet eligibility requirements
2. Apply through TikTok Creator Portal
3. Complete profile with niche, demographics, past partnerships
4. Wait for approval (typically 7–14 days)

**Benefits:**
- Brands browse and invite you to campaigns
- Secure payment through TikTok (no chase invoices)
- Access to campaign briefs and rates upfront
- Analytics showing campaign performance

**Downsides:**
- TikTok takes commission (typically 10–20%)
- Rates may be lower than direct deals
- Limited negotiation flexibility

**Alternative platforms:**
- AspireIQ
- Creator.co
- Upfluence
- Klear
- #paid

### Strategy 5: Pitch Brands Directly via Email

**Don't wait to be discovered—proactively reach out.**

**Who to pitch:**
- Brands you already use and love (authentic!)
- Brands in your niche (fitness creator → fitness brands)
- Brands running TikTok campaigns (check their TikTok account for sponsored content)
- Smaller/emerging brands (more budget flexible, faster responses)

**How to find brand emails:**
- Company website → "Influencer Marketing" or "Partnerships" page
- LinkedIn search: "[Brand] influencer marketing manager"
- Email format guess: partnerships@brand.com, influencer@brand.com
- Use tools: Hunter.io, RocketReach

**Email template:**

```
Subject: TikTok Partnership Opportunity - [Your Niche] Creator (100K Engaged Audience)

**Pro tips:**

## How to Price Your Brand Deals

### Pricing Formula

**Basic calculation:**
```
Base Rate = (Follower Count ÷ 1,000) × $10
```

**Example:**
- 50,000 followers → $500 base rate

**Adjustments:**

**Multiply rate by engagement factor:**
| Engagement Rate | Multiplier |
|----------------|------------|
| <2% (low) | 0.7× |
| 2–4% (average) | 1.0× |
| 4–6% (good) | 1.3× |
| 6–10% (excellent) | 1.5× |
| >10% (outstanding) | 2.0× |

**Example:**
- 50K followers × $10 = $500 base
- Engagement rate 7% (excellent) = 1.5× multiplier
- **Final rate: $750**

**Niche adjustments:**
| Niche | Multiplier |
|-------|------------|
| Finance, B2B, SaaS | 1.5–2.0× |
| Beauty, Fashion, Lifestyle | 1.0–1.2× |
| Food, Travel | 1.0–1.2× |
| Fitness, Health | 1.1–1.3× |
| Comedy, Entertainment | 0.8–1.0× |
| Gaming | 0.8–1.0× |

**Additional fees:**
- Spark Ads authorization: +30–50% of base rate
- Exclusivity (can't promote competitors): +25–100%
- Usage rights (brand repurposes content): +20–50%
- Rush delivery (<7 days): +20–30%
- Cross-platform (TikTok + Instagram): +50–100%

## Negotiating Brand Deals

### What to Negotiate

1. **Rate** (obviously)
2. **Deliverables** (how many videos, what format)
3. **Timeline** (when content is due)
4. **Usage rights** (can brand repurpose your content? For how long?)
5. **Exclusivity** (can you work with competitors?)
6. **Creative freedom** (how much control do you have over content?)
7. **Payment terms** (50% upfront, 50% upon delivery recommended)

### Negotiation Tips

**Start higher than your minimum:**
If you'll accept $500, quote $650–$750. Brands often negotiate down 15–20%.

**Don't be the first to name a price:**
Ask: "What's the budget for this campaign?" Let them anchor.

**Bundle for higher total value:**
Instead of $500 for one video, offer $1,200 for three videos (saves them per-video cost, increases your total).

**Anchor on value, not follower count:**
"My audience has a 9% engagement rate—3× the industry average—which drives significantly higher ROI for brands."

**Use competing offers as leverage:**
"I have another offer for a similar partnership at $X. I'd prefer to work with you—can you match?"

**Be willing to walk away:**
If rate is too low and they won't budge, politely decline. Underpricing hurts you and the creator economy.

## Red Flags in Brand Deals

### 🚩 Avoid These Situations

**1. "We'll pay you in exposure/free product only"**
- **When it's okay:** If you're under 5K followers and product value is high
- **When to decline:** If you're 10K+ followers—your content has monetary value

**2. "We need content posted immediately" (without fair rush fee)**
- Brands rushing often have poor planning; expect issues

**3. "You can't see the contract until you agree"**
- Always review contract before committing

**4. "We own all rights to your content forever"**
- Limit usage rights to 6–12 months

**5. "We'll pay you after the post performs well"**
- Payment should be for content creation, not results (you can't control algorithm)

**6. "Remove any negative comments about the product"**
- FTC requires transparency; you can't hide genuine customer feedback

**7. No written contract**
- Always get agreement in writing (email counts, but formal contract is better)

**8. Payment only after video hits X views**
- Your payment shouldn't depend on TikTok's algorithm

---

## Legal Requirements and FTC Compliance

### You MUST Disclose Paid Partnerships

**Legal requirement (FTC in US, similar rules globally):**
- Clearly disclose when content is sponsored
- Disclosure must be easy to see (not hidden)

**How to disclose:**
1. **Use TikTok's "Paid Partnership" label** (best practice)
   - Add when posting video
   - Visible to viewers

2. **Include #ad or #sponsored in caption**
   - At the beginning, not buried at the end

3. **Say it verbally in the video**
   - "Thanks to [Brand] for sponsoring this video"

**Bad disclosure:**
> #partner (too vague)
> #spon (not clear enough)
> Hashtag buried after 20 other hashtags

**Good disclosure:**
> "Paid partnership with [Brand]" label + #ad in caption + verbal mention

**Consequences of not disclosing:**
- FTC fines ($10,000–$43,000 per violation)
- Account suspension
- Loss of brand trust
- Legal liability

## FAQ

### How many followers do I need to get brand deals?
As few as 1,000–5,000 if you have strong engagement. Nano-influencers (5K–10K) are highly sought after for authentic niche audiences.

### Should I do free brand deals?
Occasionally, if: (1) Product value is high ($100+), (2) Brand is prestigious and boosts your credibility, (3) You're under 5K followers. But don't make it a habit—brands should pay for your work.

### How do I respond if a brand offers too little?
Politely counter: "Thanks for the offer! Based on my engagement rate and audience demographics, my rate for this deliverable is $X. I'm happy to discuss a package that works for your budget."

### Can I negotiate after signing a contract?
Generally no. Negotiate before signing. Read carefully before committing.

### What if a brand doesn't pay?
Prevention: (1) Use contracts, (2) Request 50% upfront, (3) Don't post content until paid, (4) Use platforms like TikTok Creator Marketplace with payment protection.
If already unpaid: Send invoice reminders, threaten small claims court, report to FTC if fraudulent.

### Should I work with brands I don't use?
Only if you'd genuinely recommend the product after trying it. Your audience trusts you—don't jeopardize that for a paycheck.
