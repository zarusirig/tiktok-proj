## FAQ

### How long does Creator Fund application take?
Most applications are reviewed within 24–72 hours. Complex cases or high-volume periods may extend to 7 days.

### Can I apply if I live in an ineligible country but have a VPN?
No. TikTok detects your actual location through multiple signals. VPN use violates terms of service and will result in permanent account suspension.

### Do I need a business account to join Creator Fund?
No. Personal accounts are eligible. However, switching to a Creator Account (free) gives you access to analytics needed to track performance.

### Can I be in Creator Fund and also do brand deals?
Yes! Most creators use Creator Fund as passive income while actively seeking brand deals, which typically pay much more.

### What happens to my old videos before I joined?
Only videos published after your approval date earn Creator Fund payments. Previous videos don't retroactively generate earnings.

### Can I leave Creator Fund and rejoin later?
Yes. You can opt out at any time in Creator Tools. To rejoin, simply reapply (assuming you still meet requirements).

### Is there a limit to how much I can earn?
No cap on earnings. Your earnings depend entirely on views, engagement, and content performance.

### Do LIVE videos count toward Creator Fund?
No. LIVE videos don't generate Creator Fund earnings. However, you can earn from LIVE Gifts separately.
