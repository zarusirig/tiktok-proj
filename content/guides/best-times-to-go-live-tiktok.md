## Best LIVE Times (US Audience)

### Peak Times (Highest Viewership)

**Weeknights: 7–10 PM EST (4–7 PM PST)**
- **Why:** After work/school, before bedtime
- **Viewer behavior:** Relaxed, engaged, willing to stay longer
- **Best for:** Q&A, tutorials, community hangouts

**Weekends: 12–3 PM EST and 7–10 PM EST**
- **Why:** Midday (people browsing casually) and evening (prime time)
- **Viewer behavior:** More leisurely, higher engagement
- **Best for:** Longer streams, interactive content

### Secondary Times (Good Viewership)

**Weekday Mornings: 8–10 AM EST (5–7 AM PST)**
- **Why:** Morning routine browsing, commute scrolling
- **Viewer behavior:** Quick check-ins, shorter sessions
- **Best for:** Morning motivation, quick tips

**Lunch Hours: 12–1 PM EST (9–10 AM PST)**
- **Why:** Lunch break browsing
- **Viewer behavior:** 15–30 min sessions
- **Best for:** Short, focused streams

**Late Night: 11 PM–1 AM EST (8–10 PM PST)**
- **Why:** Night owls, insomnia browsing
- **Viewer behavior:** Lower volume but highly engaged
- **Best for:** Chill hangouts, niche content

### Times to Avoid (Low Viewership)

❌ **Early Morning: 4–7 AM EST**
- Most people sleeping

❌ **Workday Hours: 9 AM–5 PM EST (Mon–Fri)**
- People at work/school (unless your niche is stay-at-home parents, remote workers)

❌ **Dinner Time: 5:30–6:30 PM EST**
- People eating dinner, not on phones

## Best LIVE Times (UK Audience)

### Peak Times

**Weeknights: 7–10 PM GMT**
- After work, before bed (same as US pattern)

**Weekends: 1–4 PM GMT and 7–10 PM GMT**
- Saturday/Sunday afternoons and evenings

### Secondary Times

**Weekday Evenings: 6–7 PM GMT**
- Immediately after work (higher engagement than US due to earlier dinner culture)

**Sunday Mornings: 10 AM–12 PM GMT**
- Lazy Sunday browsing

---

## Best LIVE Times (Global/International Audience)

### Strategy for Global Followers

**If your followers are spread across timezones:**
- Check TikTok Analytics (Followers → Territory) to see top 3 countries
- Prioritize largest audience timezone
- Rotate LIVE times to serve different regions

**Example:**
- Monday/Wednesday/Friday: 8 PM EST (serves US + Latin America)
- Tuesday/Thursday: 2 PM EST / 7 PM GMT (serves UK + Europe)
- Saturday: 10 PM EST / 3 AM GMT / 10 AM Asia (serves Asia-Pacific)

**Pro tip:** Going LIVE at "off-peak" times can actually increase earnings if you have engaged followers in that timezone (less competition from other creators).

---

## Best Days of the Week

### High-Engagement Days

**Thursday and Friday**
- **Why:** Weekend anticipation, people more relaxed
- **Earnings:** 10–20% higher than Mon–Wed
- **Best for:** Major streams, special content

**Sunday**
- **Why:** Day off, people scrolling leisurely
- **Earnings:** Consistent, high engagement
- **Best for:** Community hangouts, long streams

### Moderate-Engagement Days

**Tuesday and Wednesday**
- **Why:** Mid-week routine
- **Earnings:** Steady, predictable
- **Best for:** Regular scheduled streams

**Saturday**
- **Why:** People busy with plans (afternoon), free at night
- **Earnings:** Varies widely (afternoon low, evening high)
- **Best for:** Evening/night streams only

### Lower-Engagement Days

**Monday**
- **Why:** Back-to-work blues, people busy
- **Earnings:** 10–15% lower than Thu/Fri
- **Consider:** Skip or do shorter streams

---

## How to Find YOUR Best LIVE Times

### Step 1: Check TikTok Analytics

**Go to Creator Tools → Analytics → Followers**
- Scroll to **"When your followers are on TikTok"**
- Shows hour-by-hour activity (in your timezone)
- Darker colors = more active

**Interpretation:**
- Peak hours = when to go LIVE
- Your followers' activity may differ from general patterns

**Example:**
> Your analytics show peak activity: 6–9 PM your time
> General best practice: 7–10 PM EST
> → Use YOUR analytics (6–9 PM) if different

---

### Step 2: Test Different Times (2-Week Experiment)

**Week 1: Test 3 different times**
- Stream A: Weeknight 7 PM
- Stream B: Weekend 2 PM
- Stream C: Weeknight 9 PM

**Week 2: Repeat same times**
- Confirm consistency

**Track metrics:**
- Peak concurrent viewers
- Average watch time
- Total gifts received
- Engagement (comments per minute)

**Analyze:**
- Which time had highest viewers?
- Which time had highest earnings per viewer?
- Which felt most engaged?

---

### Step 3: Consider Your Niche

**Niche-specific optimal times:**

| Niche | Best Times | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Fitness | 6–8 AM, 5–7 PM | Workout times |
| Gaming | 8 PM–12 AM | After-work gaming hours |
| Finance/Business | 7–9 AM, 12–1 PM | Morning routine, lunch break |
| Beauty/Fashion | 7–10 PM | Evening relaxation |
| Cooking | 5–7 PM | Dinner prep time |
| Parenting/Kids | 10 AM–2 PM | Naptime for parents |
| Student Content | 3–5 PM, 9–11 PM | After school, late night study breaks |

## Consistency vs. Optimization

### The Consistency Rule

**More important than "perfect" time:**
- Going LIVE at the same day/time each week
- Builds audience habit ("I know they're LIVE every Thursday at 8")
- Algorithm recognizes your pattern and promotes your LIVE

**Example:**
> Going LIVE Tuesday 8 PM (good time, consistent) > Going LIVE randomly between 2 PM and 11 PM (maybe "optimal" but inconsistent)

### Building Your Schedule

**Ideal weekly schedule:**
- Pick 3–5 days per week
- Same time each day (±1 hour flexibility okay)
- Announce schedule in bio: "LIVE: Mon/Wed/Fri 8 PM EST"
- Stick to it for at least 4 weeks (builds habit)

**Example schedule:**
- Monday: 8 PM (Q&A)
- Wednesday: 8 PM (Tutorial/Tips)
- Friday: 9 PM (Community Hangout)
- Sunday: 3 PM (Behind-the-scenes)

## Adjusting for Audience Demographics

### Age Demographics

**Younger audience (13–17):**
- Best times: 3–5 PM (after school), 8–11 PM (before bed)
- Avoid: School hours, very late night

**College age (18–24):**
- Best times: 9 PM–1 AM (night owls)
- Good: Afternoon (flexible schedules)
- Avoid: Early morning

**Working professionals (25–40):**
- Best times: 7–10 PM, weekends
- Avoid: 9 AM–5 PM weekdays

**Stay-at-home parents:**
- Best times: 10 AM–2 PM (during kids' activities/naps), 8–10 PM (after kids' bedtime)

**Retirees (55+):**
- Best times: Morning (8–11 AM), early evening (5–7 PM)

---

## Special Considerations

### Holidays and Events

**Higher viewership:**
- Thanksgiving Eve (Wed night before Thanksgiving)
- New Year's Eve/Day
- Snow days / unexpected days off
- Major pop culture events (if relevant to your niche)

**Lower viewership:**
- Christmas Day, Thanksgiving Day (people with family)
- July 4th, other major holidays
- Super Bowl Sunday (for non-sports creators)

**Strategy:** Announce special LIVE streams for holidays ("Christmas Eve LIVE hangout!").

---

### Seasonal Patterns

**Summer (June–August):**
- Daytime streams perform better (people have flexible schedules)
- Weekday patterns less pronounced (vacations)

**School Year (Sept–May):**
- Evenings and weekends much stronger
- Weekday afternoons weak (people busy)

**Holiday Season (Nov–Dec):**
- December earnings typically 20–30% higher (gift-giving mentality)
- Post-holiday (Jan–Feb) dips 10–15%

---

## Promoting Your LIVE Time

### Announce Schedule Consistently

**In your bio:**
> "LIVE: Mon/Wed/Fri 8 PM EST 🔴 | Follow for alerts"

**Post reminders:**
- 24 hours before: "Going LIVE tomorrow at 8 PM!"
- 2 hours before: "LIVE in 2 hours! See you at 8 PM"
- 10 min before: "Starting LIVE in 10 minutes!"

**Use TikTok's "Schedule LIVE" feature (if available):**
- Allows followers to set reminders
- Sends push notification when you go LIVE

## FAQ

### Should I go LIVE at different times to test, or stick to one time?
Test for 2–3 weeks, then commit to best-performing time for consistency.

### What if my best time conflicts with my schedule?
Prioritize YOUR availability over "optimal" time. Consistent LIVE at 6 PM > inconsistent LIVE at "optimal" 8 PM.

### Do weekends or weekdays earn more?
Weekends (especially Sunday) typically have higher engagement, but weeknights (Thu/Fri) are also strong. Test both.

### Should I avoid going LIVE when big creators in my niche are live?
Slight disadvantage (viewers split), but not a major issue. Focus on your schedule consistency.

### How long should I wait to see if a time works?
Try each time 3–4 times before judging. One-off low performance could be fluke.

### Can I go LIVE at random times occasionally?
Yes, but maintain your core schedule. Bonus streams are fine, but consistency is key for growth.
