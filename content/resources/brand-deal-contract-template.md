## When to Use a Contract

### Always Use a Written Agreement For:

✅ Any payment over $200
✅ Multi-video campaigns
✅ Exclusive partnerships
✅ Usage rights beyond 90 days
✅ Cross-platform content requirements
✅ Campaigns with strict deadlines

### You Might Skip a Formal Contract For:

⚠️ Gifted product under $100 (email confirmation sufficient)
⚠️ One-time posts under $200 with trusted brands (but still get email confirmation)

**Best practice:** Even small deals benefit from written terms. An email exchange confirming deliverables, rate, and timeline counts as a contract.

## Clause-by-Clause Explanation

### Section 1: Services (Deliverables)

**What to specify:**
- Exact number of videos
- Platform(s): TikTok only, or TikTok + Instagram?
- Approximate video length (flexibility is good)
- Key messaging points or product features to highlight
- Hashtags required (but maintain authenticity)

**Red flag:** Brand dictates exact script word-for-word (kills authenticity—negotiate creative freedom)

---

### Section 2: Posting Schedule

**What to include:**
- Draft submission deadline (gives brand time to review)
- Brand feedback deadline (prevents endless delays)
- Final posting deadline
- Timezone (important if brand is in different region)

**Pro tip:** Build in buffer time. If brand needs content by Friday, set internal deadline for Wednesday.

---

### Section 3: Compensation

**Payment structures:**

**Best for creators (especially new relationships):**
- 50% upfront, 50% upon posting

**Brand-friendly (if you have established relationship):**
- 100% upon posting

**Avoid:**
- Payment contingent on views/engagement (you can't control algorithm)
- Payment 60+ days after posting (long wait, cash flow issues)

**Late payment clause:** Always include. Many brands pay slowly—this motivates timely payment.

---

### Section 4: Usage Rights

**Critical section—read carefully!**

**Non-exclusive license (recommended):**
- Brand can use your content
- You can still post on your own channels
- You can reuse content in portfolio

**Exclusive license (charge 2–3× more):**
- Brand has sole rights
- You can't repost or use in portfolio
- Usually not worth it unless premium payment

**Duration options:**
- 90 days: Fair for most campaigns
- 1 year: Charge +25–50% more
- Perpetuity: Charge +100–200% more (or avoid)

**Spark Ads:** If brand can use content as paid ads, charge +30–50% extra.

---

### Section 5: Exclusivity

**Three options:**

**Option A: No exclusivity (most common)**
- You can work with any brands anytime
- Best for creators building diverse partnerships

**Option B: Category exclusivity**
- Can't promote competing brands in same category for X days
- Charge +25–50% more
- Example: If promoting Nike, can't promote Adidas for 60 days

**Option C: Full exclusivity (rare, very expensive)**
- Can't promote any brands for duration
- Charge +100–200% more (essentially paying for lost opportunities)

**Pro tip:** Define "competing brands" explicitly. Is Gatorade a competitor to Coca-Cola? Clarify.

---

### Section 6: Creative Control

**Balance:**
- Creator needs authenticity to maintain audience trust
- Brand needs messaging alignment for campaign goals

**Approval process:**
- 2 rounds of revision is fair
- Brand can't demand unlimited revisions
- If can't agree after 2 rounds, allow termination without penalty

**What creator maintains control over:**
- Tone and style
- How product is presented (within reason)
- Personal opinion and authentic reaction

**What brand maintains control over:**
- Factual accuracy ("This product has X feature")
- Legal claims ("clinically proven," "best in class")
- Alignment with brand values (no controversial content)

---

### Section 7: FTC Disclosure

**Non-negotiable.**

If brand asks you to hide sponsorship or avoid #ad, refuse. Illegal and puts you at risk.

Make clear you are responsible for compliance (not brand) but also that you will absolutely disclose per FTC requirements.

---

### Section 8: Content Standards

**Protects both parties:**
- Creator: Won't be asked to make false claims or violate TikTok policies
- Brand: Creator won't create offensive/inappropriate content

Include clause allowing creator to refuse content that violates their values or TikTok rules.

---

### Section 9: Performance Metrics

**Three approaches:**

**Option A: No guarantees (recommended for most deals)**
- You're paid for creation, not results
- Can't control TikTok algorithm
- Protects you if video underperforms

**Option B: Reporting only**
- You share metrics with brand
- Helps brand evaluate ROI
- Doesn't tie payment to performance

**Option C: Performance bonus**
- Base payment guaranteed
- Bonus if hits certain metrics
- Only agree if bonus is substantial and metrics are achievable

**Avoid:** Payment only if video hits X views (algorithm is unpredictable—too risky)

---

### Section 12: Termination

**Key question: What happens if someone wants to cancel?**

**Before work starts:**
- Easy—either party can cancel, no penalty

**After work starts:**
- If brand cancels: Should pay 50–100% (you've invested time)
- If you cancel: May need to refund 50% if no good reason

**For cause termination:**
- If brand doesn't pay: You can terminate and keep content
- If you don't deliver: Brand doesn't have to pay

---

## Red Flags in Brand Contracts

### 🚩 Avoid These Clauses

**1. "Payment contingent on video reaching X views"**
- You can't control algorithm—too risky
- Counter: Guaranteed payment + optional performance bonus

**3. "Brand may use content for any purpose, including sublicensing to third parties"**
- Your content could be sold or used in ways you don't approve
- Counter: Define specific permitted uses

**4. "Creator may not work with any other brands for 12 months"**
- Full exclusivity for extended period kills your income
- Counter: Category exclusivity for 30–90 days max, or charge 10× rate

**5. "Brand may request unlimited revisions"**
- Endless work loop with no end
- Counter: 2 rounds of reasonable revisions

**6. "Creator may not disclose payment amount under any circumstances"**
- Prevents you from discussing deals with accountant, lawyer
- Counter: Can't disclose publicly, but can for business/legal purposes

**7. "Payment within 90 days of posting"**
- Too long to wait (cash flow issues)
- Counter: Payment within 15–30 days

**8. "Brand may terminate at any time without compensation"**
- Brand can cancel after you've done work and not pay
- Counter: If brand cancels after work begins, pays 50–100%

**If you see these:** Negotiate or walk away.

## When to Hire a Lawyer

**Use this template for:**
- Deals under $10,000
- Single-video campaigns
- Standard brand partnerships
- Brands you've worked with before

**Hire a lawyer for:**
- Deals over $10,000
- Multi-year ambassador contracts
- Exclusivity agreements (especially full exclusivity)
- Complex intellectual property licensing
- International brand deals
- Any time you're unsure or uncomfortable

**Cost:** Entertainment lawyers charge $200–500/hour. Contract review: 1–2 hours ($200–1,000 typically).

**Worth it when:** Deal is large enough that legal fees are <10% of deal value.

---

## FAQ

### Do I need a contract for a $200 brand deal?
Ideally yes, but at minimum get email confirmation of: deliverables, payment amount, due date, and usage rights. Email exchanges can serve as a contract.

### What if the brand has their own contract?
Read it carefully! Brands often include creator-unfavorable terms. Negotiate or counter with your own contract. Larger brands may not budge—decide if deal is worth it.

### Can I send this contract as a freelancer, or do I need an LLC?
You can use this as an individual (sole proprietor). LLC is beneficial for liability protection and taxes but not required for contract validity.

### What if brand refuses to sign a contract?
Red flag. Professional brands always use contracts. For small deals (<$500), email confirmation is minimum. For larger deals, insist on written agreement or walk away.

### Should I send this before or after negotiating rate?
After. Once you've agreed on rate, deliverables, and timeline verbally/via email, send contract to formalize.

### Do both parties need to sign for it to be valid?
Technically, acceptance can be shown through action (e.g., brand pays you = acceptance). But signed contract is much stronger legally.
