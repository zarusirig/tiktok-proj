## What Affects Your Payment Amount

### Deductions from Gross Commissions

**1. Returns and Refunds**
- If customer returns product within return window (typically 30 days), commission is deducted
- If return happens after you've been paid, deducted from next month's payment

**2. Cancelled Orders**
- Orders cancelled before shipment = no commission earned

**3. TikTok Shop Fees**
- TikTok takes no additional fee beyond the commission split (you receive the advertised commission %)
- Example: 15% commission product sold for $100 = you get $15 (no further TikTok fees)

**4. Payment Processing Fees**
- TikTok covers payment processing fees
- PayPal/bank may charge withdrawal fees (separate from TikTok payment)

**5. Taxes**
- Payments are pre-tax (you're responsible for reporting income)
- US creators: Receive 1099 form if earnings exceed $600/year

## Payment FAQs

### When do I get my first payment?
After your first full month of earning commissions. If you start mid-month, earnings count for that month and are paid the following month.

**Example:**
- Start affiliate: January 15
- January 15–31 earnings: Paid mid-February
- February 1–28 earnings: Paid mid-March

---

### Can I change my payment method?
Yes, anytime. Changes take effect for next payment cycle. If you change mid-cycle, that month's payment goes to previous method.

---

### What if I don't receive payment on time?
Wait 5 business days past expected date. Then:
1. Check dashboard for payment status
2. Verify payment method is correct
3. Check PayPal/bank for incoming payment
4. Contact TikTok Support if still missing

---

### Do I get paid for clicks or only sales?
**Only sales.** You earn commission when a customer purchases a product through your affiliate link. Clicks alone don't generate income.

---

### Can I request early payment or withdraw before end of month?
No. TikTok Shop operates on fixed monthly schedule. Early withdrawal not available.

---

### Are there any payment limits (maximum)?
No maximum. If you earn $10,000 in a month, you'll receive $10,000 (minus any returns/refunds).

---

### What happens if my account is suspended?
Pending payments are typically held until issue is resolved. If account is permanently banned, payments may be forfeited (check TikTok Shop terms).
